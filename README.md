## Ontario's Wind Power Experiment: Who Pays, Who Gains?

### Introduction

Ontario's shift to renewable electricity has been bold. With the Green Energy and Green Economy Act of 2009, the province committed to eliminating coal and expanding clean energy, particularly wind. The move was driven by urgent climate goals and public health concerns. As of today, Ontario boasts over 5,000 MW of installed wind capacity, making up about 40% of Canada's total (Bahramian et al., 2021). But what has this transformation cost? And who has benefited?
This brief draws on Bahramian, Jenkins, and Milne’s 2021 ex-post stakeholder and economic analysis of three major wind projects in Ontario. Their findings offer a sobering insight into the consequences of well-intentioned but poorly aligned policy design. While wind farms did displace emissions and support private investment, the economic costs were several times the total benefits. Most of those costs, the authors show, were quietly passed on to ordinary ratepayers and future taxpayers.


### The Economic Reality

The paper analysed three wind farms: Melancthon I & II and Wolfe Island. Together, these projects represent a sizeable share of Ontario’s wind output and provide a window into the broader policy landscape. All three were backed by long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) that guaranteed fixed prices for 20 years. This meant that wind developers were paid regardless of when or whether Ontario needed their electricity.
The numbers are striking. The net present value (NPV) of the economic costs of these projects was $1.27 billion, while the total benefits, including fuel savings and global CO2 reductions, came to just $0.25 billion (Bahramian et al., 2021, p. 5). In effect, Ontario paid around $1 to get $0.20 of value back. Even accounting for the avoided emissions, the benefit-cost ratio was under 0.3 in the most generous scenario.
One key issue is timing. Wind generation is strongest during off-peak hours, often displacing cheaper hydro instead of expensive gas. This reduces the economic value of the wind power generated. Another problem is that much of the surplus electricity ended up being exported at rock-bottom prices to U.S. states, with Ontario ratepayers footing the bill.

### Winners and Losers

So, who gained? The clearest beneficiaries were the wind developers. The PPAs shielded them from market risk, guaranteed steady revenues, and even paid them for curtailed electricity that wasn’t needed (Bahramian et al., 2021). Ontario’s municipalities hosting wind farms also saw modest benefits, such as annual amenities fees and local taxes. For instance, Wolfe Island paid the Township of Frontenac Islands $7,500 per turbine annually. But these gains were small compared to the total public cost.
Now, to the losers, Ontario’s electricity consumers have borne the lion’s share of the burden. The cost of the wind PPAs, far above market electricity prices, is recouped through the Global Adjustment (GA) charge on electricity bills. For the three projects studied, Ontario consumers faced an estimated net loss of $654 million (NPV), or 64% of the total loss (Bahramian et al., 2021).
To soften the blow, the government introduced the Ontario Electricity Rebate (OER) in 2019, which subsidises residential bills by 31.8%. But that hasn’t solved the problem, it’s just shifted the cost to   public debt. In the analysis, the province's net loss came to $189 million NPV, about 18% of the total economic shortfall (Bahramian et al., 2021, p. 16). This means future taxpayers are picking up the tab for today's electricity policy. Another hidden consequence is the environmental benefit, while real, is modest in scale. The total global climate value of CO2 reductions for these three projects was estimated at $159 million (Bahramian et al., 2021); that’s just 13% of the total cost.

### Systemic Inefficiencies

Beyond the distribution of gains and losses, the study reveals serious structural flaws in Ontario’s electricity planning. First, the system was already largely green before wind was added. Nuclear and hydro accounted for over 90% of electricity production. So, wind mostly displaced other low-carbon sources, not carbon-heavy ones. Second, the wind's intermittency and timing didn’t align with demand. Because wind energy tends to come when it isn’t needed, it has replaced cheap or clean sources and requires backup capacity. That means the province paid twice: once for wind, and again to maintain the gas plants and other assets it couldn’t retire. Third, exports added insult to injury. Wind power that couldn’t be used domestically was dumped on U.S. markets at around $30/MWh, far below the contracted rates of $106-$116/MWh. The analysis estimated a net export loss of $155 million (Bahramian et al., 2021). Ontario essentially subsidised cheap, clean power for its neighbours.

### Policy Implications
What does this all mean for future policy? First, it shows that rapid decarbonization policies must be grounded in cost-effectiveness. Ontario’s wind push was driven more by political urgency than by economic planning. As a result, it overpaid for clean energy and locked into long-term costs. Second, the design of incentives matters. If contracts had tied payment to the value of electricity (e.g., when it offsets expensive or dirty power), rather than simply paying for volume, the province could have gotten better returns. Third, policy needs to plan for flexibility. A 20-year fixed contract made sense in 2009, but technology and demand shifted. Future contracts should include mid-term reviews or price resets to avoid overpaying as costs decline. Finally, transparency and accountability matter. The Ontario Electricity Rebate is well-meaning, but it masks the true cost of energy policy and delays hard conversations about reform. If Ontario is to build a greener and more affordable grid, those choices need to be debated openly.

### Conclusion

Ontario’s investment in wind power was not a policy failure in purpose; it achieved clear environmental goals and helped phase out coal, but it was flawed in execution. The costs were high, the contracts rigid, and the economic returns to the province modest at best. The benefits, while tangible, flowed to private investors and a few host communities, while the bulk of the financial burden landed on everyday Ontarians (ratepayers and taxpayers), first through their hydro bills, and now through public debt. This isn't a critique of renewable energy itself. It calls for smarter policy design: contracts that reflect actual value, planning that accounts for system needs, and transparency about who pays and why. If Ontario is to lead on clean energy, it must also lead on cost discipline, accountability, and long-term fiscal planning. Ontario’s experience offers lessons for Canada and any jurisdiction balancing climate ambition with fiscal responsibility.
